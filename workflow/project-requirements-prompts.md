# Project Requirements Prompts

Here are examples of prompts you can use to generate a `project-requirements-document.md` file.

```
Create an updated version of the @project-requirements-template.md file by following the instructions in @project-requirements-DOD.md with @project-requirements-inputs.md as inputs for the details of the project.

VERY IMPORTANT: Use @project-requirements-DOD.md as guidelines for your Definition of Done (DOD) and refer to the bullet points under @project-requirements-template.md for what is needed in each section.

Think through this step by step.
