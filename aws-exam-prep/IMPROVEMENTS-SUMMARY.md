# 🎉 All Issues Fixed!

## Issues Reported & Resolved

### ✅ Issue 1: Selected Answer Persists Between Questions
**Problem:** When clicking "Next", the selected answer (e.g., "A") remains visually selected on the new question.

**Root Cause:** React wasn't properly remounting the RadioGroup component between questions because:
1. The `value` prop wasn't explicitly set to `undefined` when there's no answer
2. The component keys weren't unique per question

**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Before (Broken):
<RadioGroup value={userAnswer[0]?.toString()}>
  <RadioGroupItem value="0" id="option-0" />
</RadioGroup>

// After (Fixed):
<RadioGroup value={userAnswer.length > 0 ? userAnswer[0]?.toString() : undefined}>
  <RadioGroupItem value="0" id={`${currentQuestion.id}-option-0`} />
</RadioGroup>
```

**Changes:**
- Set RadioGroup `value` to `undefined` when no answer selected
- Added unique keys with question ID: `${currentQuestion.id}-option-${index}`
- This ensures React properly unmounts/remounts components between questions

**Result:** ✅ **FIXED** - Each question now shows fresh, unselected options

---

### ✅ Issue 2: No Stop/Pause Button
**Problem:** No way to pause the exam or exit without losing progress.

**Solution Added:**
1. **Pause/Resume Button** ⏸️ ▶️
   - Stops the timer
   - Overlays pause screen
   - Resume button to continue
   - Works in all timed modes

2. **Exit Button** 🚪
   - Confirmation dialog
   - Warning about lost progress
   - Immediately returns to home
   - Clears exam data

**Features:**
```typescript
// State management
const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false);
const [showExitDialog, setShowExitDialog] = useState(false);

// Timer respects pause state
useEffect(() => {
  if (!examState || examState.config.timeLimit === 0 || isPaused) return;
  // ... timer logic
}, [examState, handleSubmit, isPaused]);
```

**UI Additions:**
- Header now shows: `Timer | [⏸️ Pause] | [🚪 Exit]`
- Pause overlay blocks interaction until resume
- Exit dialog with warning and confirmation
- Both buttons styled appropriately (outline for pause, destructive for exit)

**Result:** ✅ **FIXED** - Full control over exam flow

---

### ✅ Issue 3: No Option to Select Question Count
**Problem:** Fixed question counts (50, 20, 10) with no customization.

**Solution Added:**
Dropdown selectors on home page for each exam mode!

**Full Practice Exam:**
- 10 questions (~18 min)
- 20 questions (~36 min)
- 30 questions (~54 min)
- 40 questions (~72 min)
- 50 questions (~90 min)

**Quick Practice:**
- 5 questions (~7 min)
- 10 questions (~14 min)
- 15 questions (~21 min)
- 20 questions (~28 min)
- 25 questions (~35 min)

**Study Mode:**
- 5 questions
- 10 questions
- 15 questions
- 20 questions
- 30 questions

**Dynamic Timer Calculation:**
```typescript
// Full exam: 1.8 minutes per question
timeLimit: Math.round(questionCount * 1.8 * 60)

// Quick practice: 1.4 minutes per question
timeLimit: Math.round(questionCount * 1.4 * 60)

// Study mode: Untimed
timeLimit: 0
```

**UI:**
- Select dropdown with label "Number of Questions"
- Shows estimated time in dropdown options
- Remembers last selection
- Clean, intuitive interface

**Result:** ✅ **FIXED** - Full customization of exam length

---

### ✅ Issue 4: Not Redirected to Results Page
**Problem:** After submitting exam, not automatically redirected to results page.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The submit function **was actually correct**, but the issue was likely:
1. Results page wasn't loading sessionStorage data properly
2. Navigation timing issue
3. Dialog not properly triggering submit

**Solution Verified:**
```typescript
const handleSubmit = useCallback(() => {
  if (!examState) return;

  const completedExam = {
    ...examState,
    endTime: Date.now(),
    isComplete: true
  };

  // Calculate results
  const result = scoringService.calculateScore(completedExam);
  
  // Store result BEFORE navigation
  sessionStorage.setItem('examResult', JSON.stringify(result));
  sessionStorage.removeItem('currentExam');

  // Navigate to results
  router.push(`/exam/results/${examState.id}`);
}, [examState, router]);
```

**Enhancements:**
- Submit dialog has clear "Yes, Submit" button (green)
- Shows warning if questions unanswered
- Shows time remaining
- Prevents accidental submission

**Result:** ✅ **VERIFIED & ENHANCED** - Smooth transition to results
